Installed. This script has NOT touched any settings.json. Add this Stop hook
to the settings.json of the account you want belay running in -- start with
one account, not every account on the machine:

    {
      "hooks": {
        "Stop": [
          {
            "matcher": "*",
            "hooks": [
              { "type": "command",
                "command": "$WRAPPER",
                "timeout": 25 }
            ]
          }
        ]
      }
    }

The command above is an absolute path, which matters: a "~" in a hook
command is never expanded and the hook silently never runs.

Run it in log mode first (already the default here: JEV_BELAY_LOG=1 is set by
the wrapper) and read ~/.claude/belay/decisions.jsonl for a week before
trusting a block from it.
