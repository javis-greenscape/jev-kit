"""PostToolUse hook: notice when the kit's `browse` tool has given up.

WHY THIS EXISTS
===============

R11 is strict. A Playwright MCP browsing call is denied, and neither an
`[airlock-ok: ...]` stamp nor a repeat gets past it (airlock/rules.py,
prefilter_browser_driving). That is the right shape while the kit's own
`browse` tool can do the job for a fraction of the cost.

It cannot always. Jev's chooser sees one step at a time and only inside the
viewport, so a multi-hop goal is out of reach; measured, `browse` came back
`status: blocked` on a two-hop Wikipedia link-navigation task. A strict
rule on top of that leaves the session with no browser at all.

So this hook watches `browse` calls. When one comes back `blocked`, or the
call itself errored, it writes a small per-session row through
airlock/browse_state.py, and R11 turns from a deny into a warn for the next
thirty minutes of that session. Nothing else opens that door: with no row,
stamps and repeats still do nothing.

WHAT IT PROMISES
================

  - It never blocks and never speaks. No stdout, no stderr, exit 0, always.
    PostToolUse runs after the tool has already done its work, so there is
    nothing here worth risking a session over.
  - It only ever WRITES local state, and only for `mcp__browse__browse`.
  - Fail open by doing nothing: a payload it cannot parse, a response shape
    it does not recognise, a state file it cannot write -- every one of those
    records nothing, which leaves R11 exactly as strict as it was.

THE RESPONSE SHAPES IT HANDLES
==============================

`tool_response` for an MCP tool arrives in more than one shape, so all of
them are handled rather than guessed at. Taken from real transcripts on this
box:

  - a LIST of content blocks, which is the ordinary success shape:
        [{"type": "text", "text": "{\\"final_url\\": ..., \\"status\\": \\"blocked\\", ...}"}]
  - a STRING, which is what a failed call leaves behind:
        "Error: browse failed: a Chromium this server did not start is ..."
  - a DICT in the MCP CallToolResult shape, `{"content": [...], "isError": true}`,
    which is what browse/server.py itself returns over the wire.

The text inside is JSON from browse/server.py: `final_url`, `title`, `status`,
`steps`, `elapsed_ms`, `text`. `status` is the field that matters. `done`
records nothing.
