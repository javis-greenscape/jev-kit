"""PreToolUse hook entry point for airlock.

Mode-dependent (see airlock/mode.py for resolution order: env
AIRLOCK_MODE, else the first word of ~/.config/airlock/mode, else
"shadow"):

- shadow (default): unchanged from the original shadow-only behaviour below
  -- never blocks, never prints anything, hands the real Jev judgement off to
  a detached background process (airlock/worker.py), and exits 0 with no
  stdout, well under 100ms.
- enforce: judges SYNCHRONOUSLY, in this process, through airlock/enforce.py
  (client.ask() under a hard budget -- AIRLOCK_BUDGET_MS, default 1500ms,
  2000ms on native Windows, where there is no warm daemon and every call is
  a fresh HTTPS connection; see airlock/enforce.py:budget_ms).
  A deny is the documented PreToolUse JSON on stdout with exit 0. Fail-open
  on any timeout, exception, or malformed answer.
- off: complete no-op, same as the kill switch.

Any exception anywhere in this file is swallowed silently -- a broken guard
can never block or slow a tool call it wasn't explicitly told to deny.

Kill switch: env AIRLOCK_DISABLE=1, or the file
~/.config/airlock/disabled existing, makes this file a complete no-op and
wins over mode entirely -- for every REAL caller. The one exception is the
A/B bench (bench/run.py): --settings merges additively with the account's
own settings.json rather than replacing it (confirmed empirically), and the
account's settings.json already registers the MAIN CHECKOUT's copy of this
same hook in shadow mode. Disabling that live copy for a bench trial the
ordinary way (AIRLOCK_DISABLE=1) would also disable THIS copy, since both
read the same kill switch -- so a bench trial that wants this worktree's copy
active in enforce mode sets env AIRLOCK_BENCH_FORCE_MODE=enforce, which
makes this copy skip the shared kill switch entirely and use that mode
directly. This is a narrow, explicitly-named escape hatch for benchmarking
only -- no production caller ever sets it, and it does nothing unless the
value is a valid mode.

Wiring note for the director: add this file's ABSOLUTE path (not "~/...") to
settings.json hooks.PreToolUse with matcher "*" (EVERY tool -- the rules table
in airlock/rules.py does the filtering in code, far cheaper than a regex
matcher could). A leading "~" in a hook command silently never runs on this
box.
