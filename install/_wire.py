"""Helper for install/wire.sh.

Two jobs, both idempotent:

  1. REPOINT an existing airlock PreToolUse hook command at the deployed
     copy. Surgical text substitution, not a JSON re-serialize, so this edit
     changes exactly the hook command string(s) and nothing else about a
     hand-authored settings.json (key order, indentation, unrelated hooks).

  2. ADD whatever is missing -- the PreToolUse entry itself (a first install
     has nothing to repoint: there is no airlock hook command anywhere yet),
     the SessionStart session-check entry (a DEFAULT component: the guard
     fails open, so a dead guard is silent, and on a workstation the only
     reliable moment to say so is when somebody starts a session), the
     PostToolUse browse-unlock entry (also a default: it is the only thing
     that lets R11 stand aside when the kit's own `browse` tool has given up
     -- see hooks/airlock_browse_unlock.py), and, opt in per flag, the belay
     Stop hook and the function-hooks env var.
     Adding necessarily changes the JSON's structure, so this path
     re-serializes the whole file (via json.load/json.dump, which preserves
     existing key order -- Python dicts keep insertion order) rather than
     doing text surgery on a shape that was not there to begin with. Every
     existing key and hook survives; only the missing pieces are appended.

A file that needs ONLY a repoint (the common case on a machine that already
wired an earlier release) still goes through the byte-preserving text path.
A file that needs anything ADDED goes through the structural path, even if
it also needs a repoint -- there is no way to add new nested JSON without
becoming a JSON re-serializer for that file.

Reads NEW_HOOK, NEW_HOOK_COMMAND, APPLY, BELAY, BELAY_WRAPPER,
FUNCTION_HOOKS, SESSION_CHECK, SESSION_CHECK_HOOK, SESSION_CHECK_COMMAND,
BROWSE_UNLOCK, BROWSE_UNLOCK_HOOK and BROWSE_UNLOCK_COMMAND from the
environment (set by wire.sh) and the settings.json paths from argv.
Never touches a path not given on the command line.

# two shapes are kept as separate patterns rather than one permissive
