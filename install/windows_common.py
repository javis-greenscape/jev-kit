"""Shared machinery for the native-Windows installer, doctor and uninstaller.

The Linux installer is bash. Windows has no bash unless Git for Windows is
there, and the whole point of a native install is not to require it, so the
Windows side is Python -- which the guard already is.

The one design decision worth reading before anything else is how `current`
works, because Windows does not hand out symlink privilege to an ordinary
user and the Linux installer's atomic symlink flip is therefore not available.

WHAT WE DO INSTEAD, AND WHY
---------------------------
Two mechanisms, in this order:

1. A **directory junction** (`mklink /J`). A junction needs no privilege at
   all -- unlike a symlink, which needs Developer Mode or an elevated shell --
   and once made, `...\\airlock\\current\\hooks\\airlock.py` is a path that just
   works, exactly like the Linux symlink. It is the preferred mechanism.
   It has two limits: it is NTFS-only, and it cannot cross to a network
   location.

2. A **text pointer**, `current.txt`, holding the absolute path of the live
   release. Always written, junction or not, because it is the thing that
   cannot fail: no filesystem feature, no privilege, no volume type.

The hook registered in settings.json points at neither. It points at a small
stable launcher, `airlock-hook.py`, written once into the install home. The
launcher resolves `current` (junction first, then `current.txt`) and runs the
real hook IN THE SAME PROCESS, so there is no second interpreter start-up to
pay for. That keeps settings.json stable across every deploy and rollback: a
rollback rewrites one line of `current.txt` and the next tool call picks it
up, which is the same promise the Linux symlink makes.

The SessionStart session check gets its own launcher, `airlock-session-check.py`,
written the same way and for the same reason. Two launchers rather than one
launcher with an argument: a hook command in settings.json is a string a human
reads, and `"py.exe" "...\airlock-session-check.py"` says what it is, where
`"py.exe" "...\airlock-hook.py" session-check` says almost nothing and invites
a re-wire to drop the argument.

Nothing here ever needs Administrator, writes outside the user's profile, or
touches the registry, a service, or PATH.

settings.json points here and never at a release directory, so a deploy or a
rollback never has to touch settings.json: it rewrites the `current` pointer
beside this file and the next tool call follows it.

Resolution order, cheapest first:
  1. the `current` directory junction, if the installer managed to make one;
  2. `current.txt`, a one-line file holding the release path, which always
     works because it needs no filesystem feature and no privilege.

The real hook is then run IN THIS PROCESS (runpy, __name__ == "__main__"), so
the indirection costs one small file read rather than a second interpreter
start-up. Fail-open like everything else: if the pointer is missing or broken
this exits 0 having printed nothing, which Claude Code reads as "allow".
