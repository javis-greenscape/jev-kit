"""A local credential belt: pure-code patterns for credential-shaped text.

Ported from valentynkit/jev-commit's `jev_commit/belt.py` (MIT, see
`docs/CREDITS.md`). Two things came across:

  - the split between HIGH-PRECISION patterns, which are specific enough to
    act on, and HIGH-RECALL ones, which are not and only ever inform; and
  - the placeholder suppression, which is what stops `sk-your_key_here` and
    `password: <redacted>` from being treated as findings.

What did NOT come across is jev-commit's design around it. That tool sends the
staged diff to Jev to ask whether a matched value is a real credential, which
is inherent to the question it asks. **Nothing here sends a diff anywhere.**
This module is pure code, offline, with no network and no model call at all,
and only the redacted first four characters of a match ever reach a log row.

Used by rule R9 (`airlock/rules.py`): a `git add`/`git commit` whose own
command text carries a credential-shaped literal.
