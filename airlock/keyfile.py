"""Read the TypeSafe API key without ever printing it.

The hook process usually will NOT have TYPESAFE_API_KEY in its environment
(Claude Code hooks inherit a minimal env), so this falls back to parsing a key
file for a `TYPESAFE_API_KEY=` line. Never logs, never echoes, never shells out
to read the file (no cat/curl with the key on a command line) -- plain Python
file I/O only.

RESOLUTION ORDER -- the one place it is written down
====================================================

Everything that needs the key resolves it in exactly this order. There is one
implementation per language and no third copy: `airlock/keyfile.py` for Python
(the guard, the daemon, the health check, the eval, and the native-Windows
installer and doctor) and `install/keyfile.sh` for the shell (the installer,
the belay wrapper, the health-check wrapper, the compaction installer). Change
the order here and there, together, or not at all.

  1. `TYPESAFE_API_KEY` in the environment. No file is read at all.
  2. `AIRLOCK_KEY_FILE`, then `JEVKIT_KEY_FILE` (then the legacy
     `PLUMBLINE_KEY_FILE`, `JEV_GUARD_KEY_FILE`) -- an explicit override,
     honoured as given.
  3. the KIT default, if it exists.
  4. the GUARD-ERA default, if it exists. Still fully honoured: an existing
     install keeps working with no action at all.
  5. the path recorded in the POINTER FILE `$AIRLOCK_CONFIG_DIR/keyfile.path`,
     if the pointer passes the checks below.
  6. each path in `AIRLOCK_LEGACY_KEY_FILES` (colon-separated), in order.
  7. otherwise the kit default, whether or not it exists. If it does not,
     there is no key, and every guard fails open and judges nothing.

Steps 3 and 4 are per-platform, and only the spelling differs:

                 kit default (3)          guard-era default (4)
  POSIX          ~/.config/jev-kit/env    ~/.config/airlock/env
  Windows        %APPDATA%\\jev-kit\\env    %APPDATA%\\airlock\\env

The Windows pair goes through `paths.kit_config_dir()` and
`paths.config_dir()`, so `JEVKIT_CONFIG_DIR`, `AIRLOCK_CONFIG_DIR` and the
guard's legacy-name fallback all still apply there. The POSIX pair is
deliberately kept as the two literal paths below rather than being derived
from `config_dir()`: deriving it would make a machine that still has only a
`~/.config/plumbline` directory resolve its key somewhere the old code never
looked.

Why the kit default is not under the guard's directory
------------------------------------------------------

One `TYPESAFE_API_KEY` is read by every component in the kit -- the guard, the
belay wrapper, compaction, the document classifier, log triage, the browser
agent and the review wrapper. A key that every component reads does not belong
in any single component's config directory, so the kit-level default is
`~/.config/jev-kit/env` (`%APPDATA%\\jev-kit\\env` on Windows). Everything that
is genuinely the guard's own -- the mode file, `rules.json`, `tiers.json`, the
kill switch, the state and release directories -- stays under `airlock/`.

Why a pointer file at all
-------------------------

A hook runs with a bare environment and never sources `install/config.env`, so
a machine that keeps its key somewhere other than the default has no way to
tell the hook where. `install/install.sh` (and `install/windows_install.py`)
writes the PATH of the key file (only ever the path, never the value) into
`$AIRLOCK_CONFIG_DIR/keyfile.path`, and step 5 reads it.

That makes the pointer a security-relevant file: whoever can write it chooses
which file this process parses for a secret, and R1 in `airlock/rules.py`
protects whatever it names. So it is trusted only when:

  * the pointer file is a regular file (not a symlink, not a fifo), owned by
    the current uid, and not group- or world-writable;
  * its directory is owned by the current uid and not group- or world-writable
    (a writable directory means the pointer can be replaced wholesale);
  * the recorded path is ABSOLUTE after `~` expansion -- a relative path would
    resolve against whatever directory the hook happened to start in;
  * the recorded path is an existing regular file.

Any check failing means the pointer is ignored and resolution carries on at
step 6, exactly as if the pointer did not exist. Nothing raises, nothing
blocks. The reason is recorded in `pointer_diagnostics()` (path names and
permission bits only, never file contents) so `install/doctor.sh` can say why
a pointer is not being honoured; with `AIRLOCK_DEBUG=1` it also goes to stderr.

A world-READABLE target is a warning, not a rejection: the key is still the
one the machine intends to use, and refusing it would take the guard offline
over a permission the human can fix in one command.

The ownership and mode halves of that list are POSIX checks, and Windows has
neither a uid nor a meaningful `st_mode`. There, the two structural checks
still run (regular file; absolute, existing target) and the two permission
checks are replaced by `platform_compat.pointer_trust_notes()`, which records
what was checked and what was not instead of pretending the check passed. The
pointer is then followed: refusing every pointer on Windows would take the
guard offline over a question the stdlib cannot answer there, and claiming the
ownership check passed would be a lie. The diagnostics say which of the two
happened, and `install/windows_doctor.py` prints them.
