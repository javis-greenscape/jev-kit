"""Detached worker invoked by hooks/airlock.py.

Does the real Jev call and log write, running after the PreToolUse hook
process has already exited 0 -- so nothing here can add latency to the tool
call it is judging, or block it. Reads the hook's stdin payload from the temp
file path given as argv[1], deletes that file immediately, then dispatches to
the matching guard.

Fail-open everywhere: any exception anywhere in main() just means this one
judgement is silently lost, never surfaced.
