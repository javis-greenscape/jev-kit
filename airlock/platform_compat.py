"""Every place airlock has to care which operating system it is on.

The rest of the package imports from here rather than testing `sys.platform`
inline, for two reasons. The first is that a single module is the only way to
keep the Windows support honest: there is one list of the things POSIX gives
us that Windows does not, and it is this file. The second is testability --
every function takes an optional `windows` argument, so the whole Windows code
path is exercised by the Linux test suite by injecting `windows=True`. No test
in this repository requires a Windows machine to pass.

What actually differs, and what this module does about it:

  file locking      POSIX has `fcntl.flock`; Windows has `msvcrt.locking`,
                    which is a mandatory BYTE-RANGE lock with no shared mode.
                    We take the byte-range lock well past end of file so it
                    can never collide with the file's own data, and treat a
                    shared lock as exclusive (correct, just less concurrent).
  detached children The shadow worker must outlive the hook process.
                    POSIX: `start_new_session=True`. Windows: the
                    DETACHED_PROCESS | CREATE_NEW_PROCESS_GROUP creation
                    flags, which is the documented equivalent.
  file permissions  `chmod 0o600` means something on POSIX and almost nothing
                    on Windows, where it only toggles the read-only attribute
                    and says nothing about who may read the file. On Windows
                    we do not pretend: we skip the chmod and rely on the
                    per-user ACL that %APPDATA% and %LOCALAPPDATA% already
                    carry, and `describe_permissions` says so out loud rather
                    than reporting a mode that would be a lie.
  unix sockets      `socket.AF_UNIX` does not exist on Windows, so the warm
                    daemon has no transport there. Windows clients go straight
                    to the direct HTTPS call.

Stdlib only, and it imports nothing else from airlock, so the hot path in
hooks/airlock.py can use it without dragging in client, guards or policy.
